# Bug Fix Summary - Download Issue

## Problem Identified
The filter was working correctly but the download wasn't starting. From the logs, there was a JavaScript error:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: bulan is not defined
    at filter_changer.js:317:55
```

## Root Cause
The `selectOption` function was trying to access the `bulan` variable but it wasn't passed as a parameter to the function.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `selectOption` Function Signature
**Before:**
```javascript
async function selectOption(option) {
```

**After:**
```javascript
async function selectOption(option, bulan) {
```

### 2. Updated Function Call
**Before:**
```javascript
const isSelected = await selectOption(targetOption);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isSelected = await selectOption(targetOption, bulan);
```
